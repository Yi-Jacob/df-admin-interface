## Adding additional languages

When more than one language is supported, the language selector will be displayed in the top right corner of the application.

- User language will be detected from preference provided by browser. If browser preference is a supported language it will be selected by default.
- If language selector is enabled and user change language manually, their preference is stored in `localStorage` for future reference. If language preference is found in `localStorage`, than it is treated as default language.

- To add a new language, follow these steps:
  1. Add a new entry to the `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` array in [src/app/shared/constants/languages.ts](src/app/shared/constants/languages.ts).
     - code: The language code. This is used to identify the language in the application.
     - altCode: Alternative language code that might be provided by browser. eg en-US, en-CA.
  2. Create new translation files in [src/assets/i18n](./src/assets/i18n/) and every sub-folder.
     - Ensure label for languages are created in alternative language in [src/assets/i18n/en.json](src/assets/i18n/en.json)
       ```json
       "languages": {
         "en": "English"
       }
       ```
     - These are used to display language label in dropdown.
